Automotive Superstore (Automotive Superstore | Car Parts, Audio, Accessories & Spares Online) is a automotive parts and accessories retailer that uses delivery partners to deliver Australia wide and offers a click and collect service from its distribution centre in Sydney (Automotive Superstore | Delivery Information).  Assume that the company has only one distribution centre and maintains a Microsoft SQL Server-based warehouse management system. Design three queries to support the company's reporting activities in relation to its warehouse operations. You should only create tables that are necessary for these queries. You will need to demonstrate that your queries can produce results by creating at least two lines of dummy data in the relevant tables and showing the outputs after executing the queries. The queries should demonstrate your knowledge of JOIN and nested queries. Your answer should include screenshots of the queries and corresponding outputs and clear explanations of the importance of each query and the structures of the associated tables for monitoring operations and making managerial decisions. 

Any assumptions you make about the company's operations while designing tables and queries should be clearly articulated and justified.
